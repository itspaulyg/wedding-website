            <p id="story">We both enjoy riding bikes and so we
                planned a bike ride and picnic down by the lake on a beautiful
                August morning. We took our usual route, heading east on 75th street.
                Once we hit 1st Ave we took a right towards the beach house. We didn't
                go far before setting up for our picnic. Leah set up the picnic blanket
                while Paul got the food out, along with the ring! Paul dropped to one knee
                and proposed right before the lake. Leah gratefully accepted and now we
                are getting married this summer!
